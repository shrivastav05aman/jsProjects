            <p>Azalea is the national flower of Nepal, the state flower of Washington and West Virginia in the United States, the state
            flower of Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh in India, the provincial flower of Jiangxi in China and the state tree of Sikkim
            and Uttarakhand in India. Most species have brightly colored flowers which bloom from late winter through to early
            summer.</p>

            <p>All Paeoniaceae are herbaceous perennials or deciduous shrubs, with thick storage roots and thin roots for gathering
            water and minerals. Some species are caespitose (tufted), because the crown produces adventitious buds, while others
            have stolons. They have rather large compound leaves without glands and stipules, and with anomocytic stomata.</p>

            <p>Aster is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Its circumscription has been narrowed, and it
            now encompasses around 170 species, all but one of which are restricted to Eurasia; many species formerly in Aster are
            now in other genera of the tribe Astereae.
            The genus Aster once contained nearly 600 species in Eurasia and North America, but after morphologic and molecular
            research on the genus during the 1990s.
