                        <p>Description : His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others. He'd tried to live
                            by this motto.
                            He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money than him. But the stupidity of the group
                            of
                            people he was talking to made him change his mind.</p>

                        <p>She was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right
                            so
                            that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had
                            taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it.</p>

                        <p>"Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed
                            and
                            Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important
                            papers
                            and documents that they couldn't leave behind.</p>

                        <p>All he wanted was a candy bar. It didn't seem like a difficult request to comprehend, but the clerk remained frozen
                            and
                            didn't seem to want to honor the request. It might have had something to do with the gun pointed at his face.</p>

                        <p>Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs
                            had
                            been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown
                            from
                            hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing
                            down.</p>
